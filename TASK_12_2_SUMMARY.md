**Key Features:**
- Synthetic wave data generation for each pattern type
- Pattern comparison using correlation and feature matching
- Educational content and interpretation guides for each pattern
- Unusual pattern detection and guidance
- Export/import functionality for pattern libraries

### 2. Pattern Comparison Service (`wave_analysis/services/pattern_comparison.py`)

**Core Classes:**
- `PatternComparisonService`: Main service for comparing analyses with patterns
- `AnalysisComparison`: Comprehensive comparison results

**Key Features:**
- Complete wave analysis comparison with pattern library
- Educational explanations for different wave types

- Distance and magnitude estimation education
- Unusual pattern identification and explanation

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite

**Test Files:**
- `tests/test_wave_pattern_library.py`: 16 test cases for pattern library

### 5. Demo and Documentation

**Demo Script:** `demo_wave_pattern_library.py`
- Interactive demonstration of all features
- Example usage patterns
- Educational content showcase

**Documentation:**
- `static/education/wave_patterns/README.md`: Educational guide
- Comprehensive code documentation and docstrings

## Technical Implementation Details

### Pattern Generation
- **P-waves**: Sharp onset, high frequency (5-15 Hz), exponential decay
- **S-waves**: Gradual onset, lower frequency (1-8 Hz), larger amplitude
- **Love waves**: Dispersive, horizontal motion, long duration
- **Rayleigh waves**: Strong dispersion, elliptical motion, largest amplitude

### Comparison Algorithm
- Signal normalization and correlation analysis
- Feature-based similarity scoring (frequency, amplitude, duration)
- Combined similarity metric (60% correlation + 40% features)
- Confidence thresholds for meaningful matches

### Educational Content Quality
- Scientifically accurate wave physics explanations
- Practical interpretation guidance
- Progressive difficulty levels (beginner to advanced)
- Real-world application examples

## Integration with Existing System
