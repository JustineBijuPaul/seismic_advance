# Wave Pattern Library

This directory contains educational wave patterns and examples for learning about seismic wave analysis.

## Pattern Categories

### Basic Waves
- **P-waves (Primary)**: Fastest seismic waves, compressional motion
- **S-waves (Secondary)**: Slower than P-waves, shear motion, larger amplitudes
- **Love waves**: Surface waves with horizontal motion
- **Rayleigh waves**: Surface waves with elliptical motion

### Arrival Characteristics
- **Emergent arrivals**: Gradual onset, typical of distant earthquakes
- **Impulsive arrivals**: Sharp onset, typical of nearby earthquakes

### Frequency Variations
- **High-frequency waves**: Indicate shallow or nearby sources
- **Low-frequency waves**: Indicate deep or distant sources

### Complex Patterns
- **Noise-contaminated signals**: Real-world data quality issues
- **Unusual patterns**: Require special interpretation

## Educational Use

These patterns are designed to help users:
1. Learn to identify different wave types
2. Understand wave characteristics and their meanings
3. Practice pattern recognition skills
4. Interpret unusual or complex signals
