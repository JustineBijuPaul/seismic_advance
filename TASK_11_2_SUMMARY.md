### Basic Usage
```python
from wave_analysis.services.analysis_cache import AnalysisCacheManager
from wave_analysis.services.cached_wave_analyzer import CachedWaveAnalyzer

# Create cache manager
cache_manager = AnalysisCacheManager(mongodb=db, redis_client=redis)

# Create cached analyzer
cached_analyzer = CachedWaveAnalyzer(
    wave_analyzer=analyzer,
    wave_separation_engine=engine,
    cache_manager=cache_manager
)

# Use cached analysis
result = cached_analyzer.analyze_complete_workflow(file_id, data, sampling_rate)
```

### Cache Warming
```python
from wave_analysis.services.cache_warming import CacheWarmingService

# Create warming service
warming_service = CacheWarmingService(cache_manager, db)

# Execute warming strategies
results = warming_service.execute_all_strategies()
```

### Manual Caching
```python
# Cache analysis result
cache_key = cache_manager.cache_analysis_result(
    'detailed_analysis', file_id, result, parameters
)

# Retrieve from cache
cached_result = cache_manager.get_cached_result(
    'detailed_analysis', file_id, parameters
)
```
